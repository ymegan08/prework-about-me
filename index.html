      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Megan Cho and I am currently an undergraduate sophomore majoring in Linguistics and Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Old Tappan, New Jersey</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Chalk pastel and digital art, watching/analyzing films, fashion/design, video gaming, and playing the drum set.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software engineer/ Web developer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Los Angeles, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Shockingly, learning how to code felt similar to the times I taught myself Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and French. I have always viewed language as a key to unlock a plethora of new cultures and experiences to explore, so my drive for further knowledge has been a motivating factor to continue mastering new languages.</p>
